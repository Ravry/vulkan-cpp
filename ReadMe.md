# Vulkan Beginner Project

## 🚧 Summary
``A personal project where I'm learning Vulkan by building a simple rendering engine from scratch. This is a beginner-friendly, work-in-progress repo that documents my journey into low-level graphics programming using the Vulkan API.``


## 🚀 Project Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of the Vulkan API
- Build a lightweight, modular rendering engine
- Learn modern graphics programming concepts by doing

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) - For window and input handling
- Vulkan SDK (Download from [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/))


## 📚 Learning Resources I’m Using

- [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)
- Vulkan documentation from [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/)
- YouTube tutorials and GitHub examples

## 🤓 Notes

This project is not production-ready — it's purely for learning. The code might be rough, messy, or inefficient in places, but that’s all part of the process. I'm documenting my learning journey and improving things as I go.
